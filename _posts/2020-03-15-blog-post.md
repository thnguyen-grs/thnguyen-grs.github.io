Following the social distancing guideline, I have been working from home since March 12<sup>th</sup>. 
I am also looking for new ideas on a new research article. 
The topics-of-interest include: 
- Data fusion (w.r.t. Quality control), 
- Building roof plane segmentation for LoD2 building modelling, 
- Combination of ACM and DNN under a semi-/self-supervised paradigm.
