I will be helping running the 2020 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2020) as a session manager, since it is going to be a virtual event this year. The symposium takes place from September 26 to October 2, 2020.

I'll be managing the following sessions:

* TU2.R16: Processing and Imaging Techniques I
* WE1.R7: Optical Satellite Missions II
* TH2.R20: Detection of Objects in Complex Environments
* FR1.R19: Satellite Remote Sensing of Atmospheric Composition: Algorithms, Applications, and Process Studies II
